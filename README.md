# Diamond Puzzle
I saw this puzzle on YouTube and decided to try recreating it in Fusion 360 a try. I think it came out well.  Unfortunately, I would rate the difficulty of this puzzle at about 1 on a scale of 5. If you have 30 minutes and 8 seconds to kill, you can print this puzzle in about 30 minutes and then solve it in the remaining 8 seconds. Enjoy.

### Notes
----
I find the puzzle works best if the fit is a bit tight the first time you fit it together. I tried to size the elements optimally, but FDM printing being what it is, your results may vary.

Print two copies of `single.stl` or one of `pair.stl`. The parts are the same.
